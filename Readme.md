# Problems Solved

```
- The patients have to wait a long time for their turn in clinics/hospitals.

- So, to solve this problem, we have created an online booking appointment.
- It also has a predicter which will help them to reach hospital on time.

- They can decide whenever they want to take an appointment so that they can save their time.

- The concerns of privacy and chat leak are resolved in the private chat with doctor, since socket.io is used for chatting and rooms.

- The problem of data leak will be solved in this model, because all the data is stored in Blockchain contract, and cannot be changed.

# Feature 1

```
- Patients Can Book Appointment and Before booking  they will Get Predicted time which is implemented using [Linear Regression]

- After Booking The Details will be Shown in (Your-activity) Tab Which includes [The Token No.] and [Predicted Time left]

- The Patient cannot book a new appointment until his/her pending appointment is not completed.

- We wanted to use timer to show the time left for the appointment, but were not able to complete it.

# Feature 2

```
- Patient Can Talk Privetly With The Doctor in a Separate Room.

- Only One Patient Can Be in a Room At a time.

-The chats are deleted as soon as the patient leaves the room.

-We also tried to send request to doctor, whenever some patient wants to join room, but were not able to complete it.

# About This App

```
- The patients Can Register using their etherium Account.

- While Registering The data is Stored in [ Block-Chain Contract ], which is much more safe than anyy other database

- The time predictor in appointment feature is based on [linear regression model].

- The Contact-Us form is connected woth Email-Js. The form submissions will be sent to our email-id.

- The admin account can be accesed only by the person who has the ethereum account which is mentioned in the appointment.js file.
